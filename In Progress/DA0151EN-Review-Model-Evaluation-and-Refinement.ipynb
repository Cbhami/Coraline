In cross validation,\n","\n","1.  First, the dataset is split into k-equal groups; each group is referred to as a fold.\n","2.  k - 1 of the folds are used to train a model, and the remaining fold is used to test with an evaluation metric.\n","3.  This is **repeated** until each of the k groups is used as the test set.\n","4.  After all folds are used, there are k evaluation metric results. They are **averaged** to get an estimate of out-of-sample error\n","\n","For example, in 4-fold cross validation you would use three folds for training and then use one fold for testing. The same model would be trained and then tested 4 times using an evaluation metric. The evaluation metric that you use depends on the model, we will use RMSE and R-squared in our code example.\n","\n","#### Why is it worth the effort to perform cross validation?\n","\n","Using cross validation means that a model is trained and evaluated many (k) times, however it is still worth the computational cost because it is used to test the generalizability of the model. Generalizability is a measure of how useful the results of a study are for a broader group of people and situations. As you train a model on the training set, it tends to overfit most of the time. To avoid this situation, you can use regularization techniques. Cross validation provides a check on how the model is performing on a test data (new unseen data), and since you have limited training instances, you need to be careful while reducing the amount of training samples and reserving it for testing purposes.\n","\n","Moreover, cross validation still works well with a **small amount of data**. For example, assume that you only have 100 samples. If you do a train test with an 80 to 20 percent split, then you only have 20 samples in the test set, which is too small to generalize reliable results. With cross validation, you can have as many as k-folds, so you can build k different models. In this case, you can make predictions on all your data and then average out the model performance.\n","\n","#### Code Example\n","\n","To perform cross validation, you can use `vfold_cv()`.

It is a technique you can use to reduce the complexity of the model by adding a penalty on the different parameters of the model. After it is applied, the model will be less likely to fit the noise of the training data and will improve the generalization abilities of the model.
